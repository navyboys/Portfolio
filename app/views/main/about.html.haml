          I live in sunny South Florida with my fiance and 3 dogs. I became interested in programming and web development around 2007 and have been hooked ever since. I currently work for a boat dealership called Dusky Sportcenter. I created their web site
          =link_to 'duskyonline.com', 'http://www.duskyonline.com' 
          shortly after I was hired and have been adding features and products since then.

          I started learning Ruby on Rails with 
          =link_to 'Tealeaf Academy', 'http://www.gotealeaf.com'
          in May 2014 and finished in November. I did so well in their program that they decided to make me a teacher's assistant 2 months before I was finshed.

          Right now I'm looking for a full time position as a Ruby web developer, but I'm also available for freelance work or fun/intersting projects. My strongest skills are with back end code, but I also have a good foundation in front end html/css and working with photoshop on graphics.
        %p.scrollimation.fade-in 
          Aside from programming I like to pass the time playing guitar, mountain biking, camping, gardening, and binge watching Game of Thrones with my fiance on the couch.
