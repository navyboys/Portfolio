      This app was built with Tealeaf Academy's third course 
      =link_to '"Build Robust and Production Quality Applications"', 'http://www.gotealeaf.com/curriculum#!production-apps'
      It's a clone of netflix.com. It doesn't stream video like Netflix, but it focusus more on software design and some advance development topics. The first thing I learned while building this app was Test Driven Development. After learning the basics of TDD, I can see how it provides an exelent environment for developing robust, high quality code.

    %p Some interesting featrues and things I learned while building this:

    %ul
      %li Team colaboration with GitHub Flow
      %li Testing with Rspec and Capybara
      %li Complex registration workflow, service objects
      %li Users can invite friends to join. The friends are send a link with a temporary token which links them back to the inviter
      %li Integration with the Stripe API for billing
      %li Privileges and access control
      %li Seeding data
      %li Sending emails
      %li Use random tokens
      %li Email service providers
      %li Complex forms
      %li Self referential associations
      %li Organize cross cutting functionality with Concerns
      %li Background jobs
      %li Amazon S3
      %li Uploading files
      %li Skinny controller, fat model
      %li Wrapping APIs
      %li Beyond MVC
