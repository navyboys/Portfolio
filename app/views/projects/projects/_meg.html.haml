    %p This is a freelance project which I collaborated with a graphic designer on. I was responsible for all the code and she created the graphics. We both collaborated on the site architecture and sitemap. Maximum entertainment Group is a music production company/ music school . This site is built on WordPress. There are several custom features built in including a front page slider gallery, artist portfolio and event section. The two sections work together so they can share data.Â  The site is also ecommerce enablesd with the wooCommerce plugin. The main categories on the site (Lessons, Recording, and Rehearsal) are all eCommerce enabled.
